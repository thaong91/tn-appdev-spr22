title: Class 3 - Finally learning how to use Git the right way
---
We started the class learning about [Git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/), along with other more advanced Git use cases, and how to interact with Git via command line (vs. a GUI that we were used to in App Dev 1.)

Then, we moved back to Rails. Some key notes from this session:

- `scaffold` is a built-in generator in Rails
- `%i[]` is a shorthand for an array containing only symbols. So 
  ```[:symbol_1, :symbol_2, :symbol_3]``` 
  will be equivalent to 
  ```%i[ symbol_1 symbol_2 symbol_3]```
- In case we don't need certain routes generated by `resources`, we can use either `only: []` to specify which routes we want to keep or `except: []` to specify which routes we want to remove. For example, if we only want index and show routes for our `Movie` model:
  ```
  resources :movie, only: [:edit, s:how]`
  ```
- `devise` is a gem that helps us generate a secured Devise model and adding authentication that is oftentimes used to create user accounts (similar to the `draft:account` generator that we worked with in App Dev 1, but more robust.) More notes on Devise [here](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/880) and [here](https://guides.railsgirls.com/devise). For example:
  ```
  rails g devise user username:string avatar_url:string
  ```
