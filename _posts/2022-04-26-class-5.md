#### Sinatra: light web framework for Ruby
- First: 
    ```ruby 
    gem install sinatra
    ```
- Then: put `require "sinatra"` at the top of the `.rb` file
- Once we run  this `.rb` file, then a light web application will be spun up (same thing as `/bin/server` that we use to do)
- In the same Ruby file, we can define routes, write normal Ruby codes, etc. This is a fast and convenient way to spin up a quick web app, especially when we build a simple API with a single end-point. However, Sinatra framework is perhaps not suited for more robust applications.
