title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):
- How to createe a Github Pages page
- Markdown is cool
- I can direcly edit files on github.com
- Git is still confusing

## Some notes on get/post/patch/delete

- In HTML, there are only two methods: `get` and `post`. 
- In Rails, there are also `patch` and `delete`, which give us more robust options to update (or "patch") or delete a record. To "fake" these two methods in HTML, we use `data-method:` instead of `method:`.

## Some notes on App Dev 2 class:
- Instead of using `appdev-projects/base-rails` repo to create a blank new rails app, we'll now use `appdev-project/vanilla-rails` to create more robust Rails applications from now on.
